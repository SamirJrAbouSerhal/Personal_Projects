This personal project was my maiden project with my newly acquired Arduino UNO R3
Using the documentation provided as well as prior experiences in university courses,
I built this system to detect when an object or human gets too close to the sensor and 
to warn them with a buzzing sound, an lcd displayed message as well as warning lights!
