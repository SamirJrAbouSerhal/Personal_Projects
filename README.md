Hello everyone! This repository has quite the simple job of storing whatever personal projects I create with my arduino UNO R3. 
I will hopefully update them as time goes on and I hone my abilities with the arduino development environnement. These projects will 
all be created using electronics data sheets and examples only, so everything you see here has been authored and orchestrated by yours truly!

If you stumble upon this repository and wish to contact me, you can do so at sabouserhal@gmail.com.

Thank you and enjoy!
